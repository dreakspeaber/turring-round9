# Comprehensive Analysis of Model Failures for LLM Training

This document provides a task-by-task breakdown of model failures, analyzing how the System Message (SM) was architected to deliberately test the model's capabilities. The core principle here is that a well-designed SM should not only guide the model to success but also push it into "edge case" scenarios where it is likely to fail. These strategic failures, when identified and corrected by a trainer, become the most valuable data points for improving the model's reasoning, tool use, and adherence to complex instructions.

## Task: 807219 (E-commerce Integration Operations Intern Onboarding)

### Conversation Turn 4

**User Prompt**: "What are these ANC headphones priced at on my previous tab?"

**Model Failure**: The model did not trigger any tool. Instead, it asked for confirmation: "Would you like me to retrieve the pricing information for this product using its seller SKU (HEADPHONES-ANC-PRO) or ASIN (B09JKL012AUDIO)?"

**SM's Role in Failure**: The SM provided a clear fallback mechanism, which the model failed to execute autonomously. This failure tests the model's ability to take initiative based on a specific rule.

**SM Citation**: "When the user requests the pricing info, always drive the get_pricing tool using ASIN first, and in case you cannot fetch sufficient info, retry it using the alternative approach of seller SKU."

**Analysis for Training**: This is a classic case of the model being overly cautious and defaulting to clarification instead of following a direct instruction. The SM is perfectly constructed to test this. The trainer's correction—to directly call get_pricing with the ASIN—creates training data that reinforces the importance of following explicit, non-destructive instructions without unnecessary user friction.

### Conversation Turn 5

**User Prompt**: (Implicit, following the get_pricing call with ASIN that returned no data)

**Model Failure**: After the initial get_pricing call with the ASIN failed, the model did not attempt the fallback. It incorrectly concluded that no pricing information was available.

**SM's Role in Failure**: The same SM rule from the previous failure is at play here. The model failed to follow the second part of the instruction: the retry logic.

**SM Citation**: "...in case you cannot fetch sufficient info, retry it using the alternative approach of seller SKU."

**Analysis for Training**: This failure is even more valuable than the first. It tests the model's ability to handle a sequential, conditional workflow. The SM created a perfect "if-then-else" scenario: 1) Try ASIN. 2) If that fails, try SKU. The model failed on step 2. The trainer's correction—to call get_pricing again, this time with the SKU—provides a powerful training example for multi-step problem-solving and tool-use resilience.

## Task: 807231 (Customer Support Escalation Assistant)

### Conversation Turn 4

**User Prompt**: "Do any pending order require this item?"

**Model Failure**: The model called the get_orders tool but included Unshipped and PartiallyShipped in the order_statuses parameter, which was not requested by the user.

**SM's Role in Failure**: The SM did not explicitly constrain the definition of "pending," allowing the model to make an overly broad interpretation. This tests the model's ability to infer user intent with precision.

**SM Citation**: (No direct citation, as this is a failure of omission in the SM. The SM could have been more specific about what "pending" means.)

**Analysis for Training**: This failure highlights the importance of precise language in both the user prompt and the SM. The trainer's correction—to only include "Pending" in the order_statuses—teaches the model to map user language to tool parameters more accurately. It's a good example of how a seemingly minor detail can significantly impact the quality of the tool call.

### Conversation Turn 5

**User Prompt**: (Implicit, following the get_orders call)

**Model Failure**: The model called get_order_items for an incorrect order_id (111-9876543-2020100 instead of 111-9876543-2025002). Additionally, one of the tool calls failed, and the model did not attempt any fallback.

**SM's Role in Failure**: The SM instructed the model to try a similar tool in case of failure, which it did not do.

**SM Citation**: "Should any tool call fail, try to use a similar tool to cover that up."

**Analysis for Training**: This is a multi-faceted failure. The incorrect order_id is a classic "hallucination" problem. The failure to use a fallback tool is a direct violation of the SM. The trainer's correction—to use the correct order_id and to use the get_order tool as a fallback for the failed get_order_items call—provides rich training data on error correction and resilience.

## Task: 807232 (E-commerce Operations Specialist)

### Conversation Turn 1

**User Prompt**: "Show me the current stock for all my products."

**Model Failure**: The model immediately called get_inventory_summaries with details: true without first asking the user for their preference.

**SM's Role in Failure**: The SM explicitly instructed the model to ask for clarification on the level of detail.

**SM Citation**: "When checking the inventory summary, ask the user whether they want a detailed breakdown and adjust the tool call accordingly if it's not clear from the user's intent."

**Analysis for Training**: This is a test of the model's ability to follow a "user experience" rule. The SM is designed to prevent the model from overwhelming the user with too much information. The trainer's correction—to first ask for the user's preference—teaches the model to prioritize a good user experience over simply executing the most direct tool call.

### Conversation Turn 4

**User Prompt**: "How many orders are yet to be shipped?"

**Model Failure**: The model called get_orders with an incorrect updated_after date (2023 instead of 2025) and included statuses other than "pending."

**SM's Role in Failure**: The SM instructed the model to "interpret and convert natural or complex time expressions into precise ISO-8601 inputs." The model failed to do this correctly.

**SM Citation**: "Interpret and convert natural or complex time expressions into precise ISO-8601 inputs for tools. Always ground time in the current context and US timezones (respect DST)."

**Analysis for Training**: This failure provides excellent training data for datetime reasoning. The trainer's correction—to use the correct year and to only include the "pending" statuses—teaches the model to pay closer attention to the temporal context of the conversation.

## Task: 807235 (OmniRetail Assistant)

### Conversation Turn 1

**User Prompt**: "Can I see all the other items from the first seller I am viewing?"

**Model Failure**: The model used the get_listing_item tool, which is for a single item, instead of search_listings_items, which is for searching multiple items.

**SM's Role in Failure**: The SM contained a potentially confusing rule that may have led the model astray.

**SM Citation**: "If the user asks to find other items from any seller, use the tool get_listing_item instead of search_listing_items." (This rule is likely an error in the SM itself, designed to test the model's ability to handle potentially incorrect instructions).

**Analysis for Training**: This is a fascinating example of how a flawed SM can create a valuable training opportunity. The model followed the (incorrect) rule, which is a good sign of instruction following. The trainer's correction—to use search_listings_items—teaches the model to prioritize the user's likely intent over a literal interpretation of a single, potentially flawed rule. It's a test of common sense reasoning.

## Task: 810183 (RANGER, the Ops Pilot)

### Conversation Turn 1

**User Prompt**: "Can you check if I have any similar product like this as it's in trend."

**Model Failure**: The model's initial search with specific keywords failed, and it responded with a vague, open-ended question instead of automatically retrying with a broader search.

**SM's Role in Failure**: The SM was designed to test the model's proactivity and decisiveness, in line with its "RANGER" persona.

**SM Citation**: "If results are weak: modify exactly one or two dimensions (time window, identifier type—ASIN vs SKU, brand vs keyword, marketplace scope). Do not repeat identical queries... Keep clarifying questions short and practical; do not turn the chat into a form."

**Analysis for Training**: This failure directly tests the persona constraints. The model was not "decisive" or "pragmatic." The trainer's correction—to automatically retry the search with a broader keyword—provides a strong signal to the model about how to embody its persona. It teaches the model to take initiative and to try to solve the problem itself before asking the user for help.

### Conversation Turn 2

**User Prompt**: "Yes this is the same, do a pricing pulse for those two, current rivals and the price you think would make us competitive."

**Model Failure**: The model used an invalid parameter (Sku instead of SellerSku), failed to batch the two requests into a single call, and did not use the get_featured_offer_expected_price_batch tool as required for a "pricing pulse."

**SM's Role in Failure**: The SM provided complex, multi-step instructions for a "pricing pulse," which the model failed to follow.

**SM Citation**: "Before major pricing decisions, use get_featured_offer_expected_price_batch to optimize for Buy Box eligibility."

**Analysis for Training**: This is a test of the model's ability to follow a complex, domain-specific workflow. The SM essentially defines a new "meta-tool" (a "pricing pulse") that is composed of several individual tool calls. The model's failure to execute this workflow correctly provides a rich set of training data for multi-step reasoning and tool orchestration.

## Comprehensive Analysis and Synthesis

The common thread across all these failures is that they are not random errors; they are strategic tests of the model's capabilities, orchestrated by a well-designed System Message. The SM is used as a tool to create "edge case" scenarios that push the model beyond simple command-following and into the realm of reasoning, proactivity, and resilience.

## Key Takeaways for LLM Trainers:

### Embrace Strategic Failure
Your goal is not to create SMs that are easy for the model to follow. It is to create SMs that are challenging, that force the model to reason, and that create predictable and instructive failure modes.

### The Persona is a Powerful Training Tool
Use the persona to define not just the bot's tone, but also its behavior. A "decisive" bot should be trained to take initiative, while a "cautious" bot should be trained to ask for confirmation.

### Teach Workflows, Not Just Tools
The real value of a tool-using agent is its ability to orchestrate complex workflows. Use your SM to define these workflows, either through explicit rules or through detailed examples.

### Failure is Not the End; It's the Beginning of the Training Loop
Every time the model fails, it's an opportunity to provide a correction that will make it smarter and more capable in the future. The quality of your training data is directly proportional to the quality of the "edge cases" you design in your SMs.

By adopting this mindset, LLM trainers can move beyond simply "prompting" and into the realm of "programming" the behavior of large language models, creating agents that are not just intelligent, but also robust, reliable, and truly helpful.
